# fuxt

A complete Headless WordPress tech stack built on Nuxt 4.

Works best with the [fuxt-backend](https://github.com/funkhaus/fuxt-backend) WordPress theme and included WordPress optimized components.

Built by [Funkhaus](http://funkhaus.us/). We normally host on [Flywheel](https://share.getf.ly/n02x5z).

PS: The name Fuxt comes from [Funkhaus](https://funkhaus.us) and Nuxt. [It's provocative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eRRab36XLI).

## Build Setup

**This is just a [Nuxt site](https://nuxtjs.org), so it builds and deploys like any other Nuxt project.**

Works best with the [fuxt-backend](https://github.com/funkhaus/fuxt-backend) WordPress theme as the backend.

**First step:** Duplicate and rename `.example.env` to `.env`. Define any vars environment needed there.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# serve with hot reload Storybook at localhost:3003
$ npm run storybook

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# build Storybook for production
$ npx nuxt storybook build

# generate static project
$ npm run generate

```
